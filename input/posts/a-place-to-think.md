I've neglected my web presence for quite a while now, and I've had a couple of spaces where I intended to put information and just never got around to it.

I've long since gotten sick of dealing with hackers messing with my websites and while I do use more secure technologies for authenticating and authorizing users, the most
secure websites are the ones that don't have dynamic content in the first place. My content doesn't change often, and I can farm out the dynamic discussion part of my website to
Disqus to avoid a lot of headaches.

I started a space on GitHub pages using Wyam.io a few years back and ported across a couple of posts from my Wordpress blog on BinaryVibrance.net, but I never got around to 
porting the website itself
over to GitHub.

www.binaryvibrance.net was hacked a number of years ago, no idea when and I hadn't even noticed, so I decided to pull the plug on having a dedicated host for my website and 
bite the bullet.

I noticed that Wyam has been superceded by [Statiq](https://www.statiq.dev/) and moving across was... painless? As long as I was willing to give up the theme that I was using 
at the time. 
Not the end of the world, but I'm not a designer geared towards HTML nowadays, but I'll see what I can do later.

When I last tackled this blog, I was on an adventure for my employer to rewrite their customer relations system into Dynamics CRM. The project fell in a heap and died. I never 
had the time to 
write any further blog posts and no longer have any reason to. I've since left that employer and moved on to writing UWP software.

I had spent a lot of my personal time writing Minecraft Mods for a while and that was a fantastic period of my life where I've met a LOT of friends that I still cherish today, 
even though I've burnt out and not really interested in it any more. I even got features on the [minecraft.net homepage](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/scripting-api-now-public-beta), 
which was an absolute highlight of my life at the time.

For the last few years I've felt a yearning to write my own game, and that's where I'm at right now. I've been working on a project, that time permitting I'll start writing a 
series of blog posts about that go into the details of it.

But for now, at least my homepage doesn't advertise some church I've never heard of anymore.
