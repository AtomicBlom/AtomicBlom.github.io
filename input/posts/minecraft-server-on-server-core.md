Title: Minecraft server on Server Core? Totally PossiblePosted: 2012-06-02Tags: [ 'Server Core', 'Minecraft', 'Tekkit' ]---So seeing a couple of youtube videos got me inspired to try out a completely modded Minecraft Server. RedPower 2 looks pretty cool, and the Tekkit Server makes this super easy.Anyway, I thought to try it out on a Windows Server 2012 Release Candidate VM.So, two thoughts, you will need to install Java on the VM. I installed 1.7 x64 with no issues.You will need to open firewall ports:`PS C:\Windows\system32> New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName “Minecraft” -Profile Domain -Direction Inbound -Action Allow -LocalPort @(“25565″) -Protocol TCP`The latest JRE install will add java to the path, so after a restart, you can create a .bat file with the following (appropriate for a machine with 4GB RAM):`java -Xmx3072M -Xms1536M -jar Tekkit.jar nogui`
