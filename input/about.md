Title: About Me
---
Hi, I'm Steven Blom, known online as AtomicBlom.

I've been an avid coder for over 18 years, over languages like PHP, Java, Visual Basic for Applications, JavaScript, and my personal favourite, C#.

In my spare time I enjoy writing mods for Minecraft, most notably, SteamNSteel.

My current goal in life is to write a game that will challenge and encourage creativity for my kids.
